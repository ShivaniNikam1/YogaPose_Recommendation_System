It holds the trunk and head like a pillar with the legs as the firm foundation. As the body is steadied, the mind becomes calm. This steadiness and calmness is the first step towards real meditation. Padmasana directs the flow of prana from mooladhara chakra in the perineum to sahasrara chakra in the head, heightening the experience of meditation. This posture applies pressure to the lower spine, which has a relaxing effect on the nervous system. The breath becomes slow, muscular tension is decreased and blood pressure is reduced.

51,Siddhasana ,"Sit with the legs straight in front of the body. Bend the right leg and place the sole of the foot flat against the inner left thigh with the heel pressing the perineum (the area midway between the genitals and anus). Bend the left leg. Push the toes and the outer edge of the left foot into the space between the right calf and thigh muscles. If necessary, this space may be enlarged slightly by using the hands or temporarily adjusting the position of the right leg. Place the left ankle directly over the right ankle so that the ankle bones are touching and the heels are one above the other. Press the pubis with the left heel directly above the genitals. The genitals will therefore lie between the two heels. If this last position is too difficult, simply place the left heel as near as possible to the pubis. Grasp the right toes and pull them up into the space between the left calf and thigh. Again adjust the body so that it is comfortable. Sit on top of the right heel. This is an important aspect of 100 siddhasana. Adjust the body until it is comfortable and the pressure of the heel is firmly applied. The legs should now be locked, with the knees touching the ground and the left heel directly above the right heel. Make the spine erect and feel as though the body is fixed on the floor. Place the hands on the knees in jnana, chin or chinmaya mudra. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Siddhasana may be performed with either leg 
uppermost. Many people experience discomfort due to 
the pressure applied where the ankles cross each other. If 
necessary, place a folded cloth or piece of sponge between 
the legs at this point. At first the pressure at the perineum 
may be uncomfortable to maintain, but with practice this 
will be eased.","Siddhasana directs the energy from the lower psychic centres upward through the spine, stimulating the brain and calming the entire nervous system. The position of the lower foot at the perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for spiritual purposes. Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations in the mooladhara region, which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the area and by a rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras. This posture redirects blood circulation to the lower spine and abdomen, toning the lumbar region of the spine, the pelvis and the abdominal organs, and balancing the reproductive system and the blood pressure.",Siddhasana should not be practised by those with sciatica or sacral infections.,,,,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRfjT_63pl7QkuX1GWtyfdNBBdt-krKWiG_vg&s,,Reproductive Hormone Control,,Beginners

187,NADI SHODHANA PRANAYAMA,"Hold the fingers of the right hand in front of the face.
Rest the index and middle fingers gently on the eyebrow
centre. Both fingers should be relaxed.
The thumb is above the right nostril and the ring finger
above the left. These two digits control the flow of breath
in the nostrils by alternately pressing on one nostril,
blocking the flow of breath, and then the other.
The little finger is comfortably folded. When practising
for long periods, the elbow may be supported in the pahn
of the left hand, although care is needed to prevent chest
restriction. ","Technique 1 increases awareness of and sensitivity
to the breath in the nostrils. Minor blockages are removed
and the flow of breath in both nostrils becomes more
balanced. Breathing through the left nostril tends to
activate the right brain hemisphere; breathing through
the right nostril activates the left hemisphere. The long, slow, balanced breathing of stage 2 has profound effects,
calming and balancing the energies. ","Nadi shodhana is not to be practised
while suffering from colds, flu or fever. "," Breathing should be silent in all techniques of
nadi shodhana, ensuring that it is not forced or restricted
In any way.
As the ratio and duration increases, the breath becomes
very light and subtle. Increased ratios and breath duration
should not be attained at the expense of relaxation, rhythm
and awareness. The flow of breath must be smooth, with
no jerks, throughout the practice. ","Physical - on the breath and the counting.
Mental - it is easy for the mind to wander during nadi
shodhana. Simply be aware of this wandering tendency of
the mind while continuing the practice and the count.
This will automatically encourage the awareness to return

resting on the knees in either chin or jnana mudra.
Keep the head and spine straight, close the eyes and relax
the whole body.
Take a deep breath in and breathe out forcefully through
the nose. Immediately afterwards breathe in with the same
force. Forceful inhalation results from fully expanding the
abdominal muscles and forceful exhalation from firm
contraction of the abdominal muscles. Do not strain.
During inhalation, the diaphragm descends and the
abdomen moves outward. During exhalation, the diaphragm moves upward and the abdomen moves inward.
The movements should be slightly exaggerated.
Continue in this manner, counting 10 breaths.
Take a deep breath in and breathe out slowly.
This is one round. Practise up to 5 rounds","This practice burns up toxins and helps balance the
doshas or humours: kapha, phlegm; pitta, bile; and vata,
wind. It is a useful practice for women during labour after
a few months of proper preparation.
Because of the rapid exchange of air in the lungs, there is
an increase in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide
into and out of the bloodstream. This stimulates the
metabolic rate, producing heat and flushing out wastes
and toxins. The rapid and rhythmic movement of the
diaphragm also massages and stimulates the visceral
organs, toning the digestive system.
Bhastrika reduces the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.
It helps to alleviate inflammation in the throat and any
accumulation of phlegm. It balances and strengthens the
nervous system, inducing peace, tranquillity and onepointedness of mind in preparation for meditation. ","Bhastrika should not be practised by
people with high blood pressure, heart disease, hernia,
gastric ulcer, stroke, epilepsy, retinal problems, glaucoma
or vertigo. The elderly, those suffering from lung diseases
such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, those recovering
from tuberculosis, or in the first trimester of pregnancy
are recommended to practise only under the guidance of
a competent teacher. ","Beginners may take several free breaths between
rounds so that there is no strain.
Breathing may be practised at 3 breath rates: slow, medium
and fast, depending on individual capacity.
Slow bhastrika is approximately one breath every 2 seconds,
with no undue force on inhalation or exhalation. It is like
amplified normal breathing. It is especially useful for
beginners, but may also be practised at all stages.
Medium breathing increases the speed of respiration to
approximately one breath every second.
Fast breathing means a speed of around 2 breaths per
second. Both medium and fast breathing are suitable for
intermediate and advanced practitioners.
As abdominal muscles become stronger with regular
practice, the number of respirations may be increased by 5
per month until the count of 50 respirations is attained.","Physical - on the breathing process and the physical movement of the abdomen.

The palms and fingers of the hands 425 have many nerve root endings which constantly emit energy. When the index finger touches the thumb, a circuit is produced which allows the energy that would normally dissipate into the environment to travel back through the body and up to the brain. When the fingers and hands are placed on the knees, the knees are sensitized, creating another pranic circuit that maintains and redirects prana within the body. In addition, placing the hands on the knees stimulates a nadi which runs from the knees, up the inside of the thighs and into the perineum. This nadi is known as gupta or the hidden nadi. Sensitizing this channel helps to stimulate the energies at mooladhara chakra. When the palms face upward in chin mudra, the chest area is opened up.
